## Books, podcasts, videos, and articles I recommend, in no particular order.

### Books

- ### The Lean Startup

  _Eric Ries_

  My number one recommendation. Not just for startup entrepeneurs, but anyone who is performing any form of innovation, even in large established enterprise.

  It's about rapid learning with validated experiments, learning what your customers truly want, and constantly challenging your hypothesis with continuous timely feedback.

  Also a Great Audiobook.

- ### The Phoenix Project

  _Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford_

  Told in a novel format from the perspective of Bill Palmer, the IT manager of the fictional company Parts Unlimited.

  The company is in the middle of a transformation project, codenamed The Phoenix Project, where failure means outsourcing Bill's entire department, and success may bring the company back from falling revenues and customer dissatisfactin.

  The narrative can be a bit clumsy at times but it's a great soft introduction to the meaning of DevOps and how similar it is to Lean Manufacturing.

- ### The Unicorn Project

  Gene Kim

  The events of _The Phoenix Project_ told from a different perspective. This time the story follows Maxine, a senior developer who's moved onto the Phoenix Project after a very public outage, and told to stay out of trouble and not make waves. This one is more written for Developers and Engineers and maybe not as accessible as _The Phoenix Project_ to the wider community.

- ### The Goal

  _Eliyahu M. Goldratt_

  When you read this one you'll quickly learn where _The Phoenix Project_ took it's inspiration from. Originally published in 1984 some of the applications are a little dated are a little dated, but you can still take a lot from this book.

  Told in a business novel format like _The Phoenix Project_, and a great introduction to The Theory of Constraints, in which the throughput of any complex system is soley constrained by the throughput of a single activity.

- ### Isn't It Obvious

  _Eliyahu M. Goldratt_

  A little dated, but another business novel told from the perspective of a manager of a regional retail outlet. This book is great if you're a logistics nerd like me and love concepts like just-in-time, short inventory restocking cycles, pull based demand and ERP.

- ### Turn The Ship Around!

  _L. David Marquet_

  One of the best books I've read. The true story told from the perspective of David Marquet, the a newly appointed captain of one of the worst performing nuclear-powered submarines in the US Navy. Using an unorthodox framework he dubs 'leader-leader', he changes the culture of the crew and brings the ship's ranking into the highest of it's class.

- ### The Toyota Way

  _Jeffrey K. Liker_

  A ground up view of Toyota made for the general audience. This book covers the principles of Toyota in depth with not just a how-to, but a why. In my opinion, a must for any DevOps enthusiasts.

- ### [2 Second Lean](https://paulakers.net/books/2-second-lean)

  _Paul A. Akers_

  Paul's concept of Lean is about making it fun, easy and sustainable. No complicated value stream maps, calculations or charts. Start small by trying to make just 2 second improvements in a process, and snowballing from there. This book is available for free.

- ### [Wardley Maps](https://medium.com/wardleymaps)

  _Simon Wardley_

  Very opinionated and a bit myopic so take with a grain of salt, but there's still a lot of great wisdom you can take away.

  The core concept is like a value stream map, but the key concept is that the position of nodes on the map relate to the stage of evolution of that particular piece of technology, as well as their observability to the customer. I would start with the Youtube video first.

  Available on Medium, as well as many videos available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnFeIt-uaEc&ab_channel=O%27Reilly).

- ### Deep Work

  _Cal Newport_

  Something I'd consider compulsory reading for anyone. Cal Newport's book highlights the need for rapid learning and high level work in the 21st century market, as well as creating a work ethic that sustains a craftsman mentality.

- ### So Good They Can't Ignore You

  _Cal Newport_

  Another great book from Cal. This one challenges the concept of "follow your passion", where passion will follow being excellent at your field, not the other way around.

- ### Design is a Job

  _Mike Monteiro_

  This one is great for freelancers. It's written for Web Design agencies/freelancers, but most of the concept are applicable for any creative or technical workers. Great Audiobook as well.

- ### Ultralearning

  _Scott H. Young_

  A stratergy for aggressive, ultra fast selt learning. Scott talks about methods he believes enable 'hacking' the learning model to learn new concepts extremely rapidly.

  A bit longer than it needs to be, and the audio book isn't fantastic as it's self narrated. I'd recommend trying a written copy as it's a book you'd want to reference easily.

- ### Beyond The Phoenix Project

  _Gene Kim and John Willis_

  An audio book which is more like a long podcast episode to be honest. Gene and John talk about the DevOps movement as well as the precusors like Lean, Deming, and Goldratt. Definitely worth an Audible credit.
